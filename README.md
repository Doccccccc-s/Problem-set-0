This is the very first game I created! It’s a simple rhythm game where notes fall from the top of the screen
toward a circle at the bottom. Your goal is to press the correct key—A, S, D, or W—when the matching note
reaches the circle (the Hit Zone) to score points. Time your presses carefully because if you miss 5 notes, the
game ends. The speed of the notes increases as you score more, making it more challenging to keep up!

I’m not very artistic, so the visuals might not be super polished, but I’m proud of the overall concept. This
project was a big learning experience since it’s my first time coding a game
